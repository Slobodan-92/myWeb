            Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the
            pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside" target="_blank" class="text-color">Oliver
                Heaviside</a>, which
            predates
            Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American
            rights to it were acquired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_AT%26T" target="_blank"
                class="text-color">American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T)</a>, making him wealthy.
            Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own
            development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with
            Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely
            valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially
            submarine ones.
